# My OOP Projects

Welcome to my repository of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) projects! This repository consists of various projects focusing on different aspects and concepts of OOP. Each project includes a detailed README file, where more specific information and insights about each project are provided. Below is a brief overview of each project included in this repository.

## 1. [Geometric Shapes](./GeometricsShapes)

In this project, different geometric shapes are handled within a GUI environment, allowing for an interactive user experience in managing and manipulating geometric shapes.

- **Read more:** [Geometric Shapes with GUI README](./GeometricsShapes/README.md)

## 2. [Elevator System Design (Java Version) - Task 0](./Task0_ElevatorSystem)

This task involves designing an elevator system, including developing an algorithm to manage and operate the elevators efficiently. A GUI is also included for interaction, implemented in Java.

- **Read more:** [Elevator System Design Java README](./Task0_ElevatorSystem/README.md)

## 3. [Elevator System Design (Python Version) - Task 1](./Task1_ElevatorSystem)

Similar to Task 0, this version of the elevator system design is implemented in Python, accompanied by a GUI for an interactive user experience.

- **Read more:** [Elevator System Design Python README](./Task1_ElevatorSystem/README.md)

## 4. [Graph Display and Algorithms - Task 3](./Task2_DirectedWeightedGraphAlgorithms)

This project involves working with graphs, including displaying them and implementing various graph algorithms, all within a GUI environment.

- **Read more:** [Graph Display and Algorithms README](./Task2_DirectedWeightedGraphAlgorithms/README.md)

## 3. [Graph Display and Algorithms (Python Version) - Task 4](./Task3_DirectedWeightedGraph)

Similar to Task 3, this version of the Graph Algorithms system design is implemented in Python, accompanied by a GUI for an interactive user experience.

- **Read more:** [Elevator System Design Python README](./Task3_DirectedWeightedGraph/README.md)

## 5. [Pokemon Game - Project 5](./Task4_PokemonGame)

A Pokemon game project that showcases the application of various OOP concepts, resulting in a functional and engaging game.
